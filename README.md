# Cost Reduction through Decision Tree-Based Room Occupancy Prediction (Multiclass)

## Introduction
This repository contains a project aimed at optimizing resource costs through the use of decision tree-based room occupancy prediction in a multiclass classification scenario. The primary objective is to reduce operational expenses, particularly related to electricity consumption, by accurately predicting room occupancy.

## Background
In todayâ€™s dynamic busines landscape, optimizing resource utilization has become more critical than ever. From reducing operational costs to improving energy efficieny because of global warming issue, every single efficiency now gain counts. One area where this optimization is often overlooked but can gain significant hidden benefits is room occupancy management.
